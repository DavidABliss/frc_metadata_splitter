# frc_metadata_splitter
A short Python script to distribute Fondo Real de Cholula files among subdirectories as described in the collection's metadata

This script was written when I had very little Python experience, and is not representative of my more recent work. This repository was created primarily for demonstration purposes, to accompany a description of the script on my website.
